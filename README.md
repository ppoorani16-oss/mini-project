 Voice-Enabled Food Ordering System 
I developed a Python-based mini project that simulates a restaurant ordering system with voice interaction.
The application welcomes users using text-to-speech, allows them to select food items from a menu, and confirms the order with voice feedback.
It also provides payment options such as cash and UPI, including voice guidance for payment confirmation.
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals, conditional logic, functions, and text-to-speech integration while building a practical, real-time application.

Tools & Technologies Used
*Python
*pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech Library)
*Functions
*If-Else Conditional Statements
*User Input & Output

This project helped me understand how Python can be used to build interactive and real-time applications.
